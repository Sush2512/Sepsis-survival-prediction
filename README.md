# Sepsis survival prediction
The body's severe reaction to an infection is sepsis. It's a medical emergency that might endanger life. When an infection you already have sets off a series of events throughout your body, it results in sepsis. Sepsis-causing infections typically begin in the gastrointestinal system, urinary tract, skin, or lungs. Sepsis can quickly cause tissue damage, organ failure, and death if not treated in a timely manner.

We will predict whether the patient with sepsis will live or not by using three features that are: sex, age and septic episode number.
